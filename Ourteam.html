                          Hey!, My name is Diane and I am Jeremy's daughter! I was so inspired by my fathers love of the family barbershop that I became a proffesional hairdresser.
                          Although I never imaged I would work for him it has been an amazing ride I hope I can share with you. I specialise more with childrena and dyeing hair compared 
                          to my father but of course I can do any cut he can! I'd love to talk with you about nature and political activism or maybe I can just talk to your child 
                          about how cool dinosaurs are! (Hint: Very Cool).

                            Hi everyone! My name is Ashley. While I am not related to Diana I might as well be because of how much time we spent together in school and beyond. I am so glad
                            to be part of this amazing experience in The Laurier Barbershop. I am more of a generalist compared to my co-workers and can do any cut you like and give you advice 
                            on how to look good all the time! While I share Dianas love for the environement I feel as if I've enough of that in my life to be talking to you about it. I'd rather 
                            discuss anything modern in the news. Whether it be political, sports or just celebrity drama I love how interesting the world is.
                        </p>

                            Hello, my name is Jeremy and I am the owner and operator of this fine Barbershop. I was a busisness analyst for almost 10 years before I decided to pursue my passion and open
                            a Barbershop in my homwtown of Ottawa. I specialise in cuts and fades as well as trimming and cutting beards and moustaches. If you want to have the premium experience of
                            a hot towel facial cleanup I am your man. While I cut your hair I'd love to talk to you about almost anything. I am a big sports fan and follow most of the major North
                            American sport leagues (I especially love the NHL, Go Sens Go!). I always love taling to new people and hearing new perspectives about the world
                        </p>
